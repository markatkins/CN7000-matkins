## 2026-02-10 Task: readme-creation — Completion Notes
- 90 lines total (within 80-150 target)
- Expanding Product Overview into two paragraphs (breaking the long single paragraph) helped readability and line count
- Key Technologies split into two sub-lists (Languages/Build + Frameworks/Tools) adds visual structure without verbosity
- Submodules section with H3 sub-headings for earlysim/hlc gives room for brief descriptions without duplicating earlysim/README.md content
- Tone matches AGENTS/start_here.md: terse, navigational, link-forward
- All 10 QA scenarios passed on first attempt; all 16 relative links validated
- Commit: 8f7b1c3 docs: add root README.md with repository overview and navigation
- Plan COMPLETE — all checkboxes marked
