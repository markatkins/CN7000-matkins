description: Review PMR HAS against datamodel
---
Compare the datamodel/protocols with the PMR HAS in docs/HAS/PMR. Start with packet-formats.md. Give a detailed accounting of mismatches and create work items to address them. Results and a plan should be stored in datamodel/protcols/working/reviews/
Do docs/HAS/PMR/WORK.md or docs/HAS/PMR/working/pmr-datamodel-alignment-plan.md address any of the items in reviews/has-datamodel-comparison.md/has-datamodel-comparison.md.
If has-datamodel-comparison.md exists, then archive it first. Add an extension with the timestamp of the last time the previous has-datamodel-comparison.md file was modified using the format <4 digit year><2 digit month><2 digit day>. Also, use the same style for the new version.
Please update has-datamodel-comparison.md with references to WORK.md or pmr-datamodel-alignment-plan.md where there are items that directly or partially address items in has-datamodel-comparison.md.
