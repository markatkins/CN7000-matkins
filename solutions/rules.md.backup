# Solutions Matrix Rules

## Table Formatting Rules

### Header Rules
1. Do NOT include "CN7000" in table column headers - it is implied
2. Column headers should be concise: "Small-Medium Scale", "Large Scale", "Hyperscalar"

### Cell Content Rules
1. **Minimize characters in cells** - brevity is paramount
2. Use checkmarks (✓) when a feature is fully supported with no qualifications needed
3. Use parentheses for qualifications only when necessary, e.g., "(island)" for heterogeneous
4. Do NOT expand acronyms in table cells - define them in the glossary instead
5. If both options of a pair are supported (e.g., SDR and Packet Spray), use only ✓
6. If only one option of a pair is supported, indicate which one in parentheses

### Scale Specifications
1. **Small-Medium Scale**: Max endpoints ≤10K
2. **Large Scale**: Max endpoints 10K-93K  
3. **Hyperscalar**: Max endpoints 100K-1.44M
4. Always indicate max endpoints per rail assuming 8 rails (e.g., 1.44M/8 = 180K per rail)

### Topology Rules
1. **Small-Medium Scale**: Single Fat-tree or Rail
2. **Large Scale**: Fat-Tree Rail
3. **Hyperscalar**: Fat-Tree Rail
4. Megafly and Dragonfly are NOT supported for AI workloads (HPC only until otherwise decided)

### Feature Naming Conventions
1. **FGAR** - Do not expand to "Fine-Grained Adaptive Routing"
2. **ECAR** - Entropy Controlled Adaptive Routing (not "Enhanced Congestion")
3. **Dynamic Route Recovery** - Do not call it "Fast Route Recovery" or indicate "dynamic rerouting"
4. **NSCC** - Do not indicate "RTT-based"; supports both lossless and lossy
5. **RCCC** - Do not expand to "receiver credit control"
6. **Collective Accel** - Do not indicate "RISC-V line-rate reduce"; indicate "homogeneous/island only"

### Protocol/Feature Support Notation
1. **ECN**: Include RoCE as supported alongside UE and Ethernet
2. **Interoperability Mode**: For Heterogeneous, add "(island)" in parentheses

### Glossary Requirements
1. All acronyms used in tables MUST be defined in the glossary at the end of the document
2. Glossary entries should be alphabetically ordered
3. Format: `**ACRONYM** - Full expansion and brief description`
